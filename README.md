# Date-Knight
 A responsive web application designed to ignite the spark of romance and inspire unforgettable moments for couples by generating personalised date ideas.

## UX
### Colour Schemes
We have used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e11d48-f43f5e-fb7185-fff1f2-ffffff) to generate our colour pallete. The selection of these colors was chosen to encapsulate the essence of Valentine's Day and evoke the emotions associated with a romantic date.
